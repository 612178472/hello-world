Iron Wired is an application for Normal Community High School students to be able to access multiple features and resources in one application. This application contains information about different activties & clubs, lunch menu, and school calendar. In addition to this, students are able to email their teachers and make a to-do list to prioritize tasks to complete for each class that they take. Overall, this application makes it more efficient for students to complete their tasks faster. 

This application was programmed entirely in Apple's Swift language. The backend was coded with MySQL for databases.

## Key Features

* Backend relational database to store information inputted by the users
* Well commented database access code
* Bug reporting to enable continuous development
* Export feature to share profile to different social media platforms
* Database for contacting teachers via embedded email access

## Getting Started

The following are the best ways to test Iron Wired given your access to certain devices.

### Mac OS Computer
Download XCode from the Mac App Store and create a free developer account on [Apple's Developer Portal](developer.apple.com)






Mac OS Computer
Download XCode from the Mac App Store and create a free developer account on Apple's Developer Portal

XCode is a large download so you can test HHS Library on your personal Apple device with TestFlight in the meantime.
Once you are done downloading XCode, consult the Installation and Use section of this ReadMe.

Windows and iPhone
The best solution for adjudicators with a Windows and iOS device is to open the code on a text editor (we recommend Atom or Sublime Text) in Windows and test app functionality on a personal iOS device.
